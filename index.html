		<h1>How long will the coronavirus last</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>It's too soon to tell how long the pandemic will continue.It depends on many things,including researchers' work to learn more about the virus,their search for a treatment and a vaccine,and the public's efforts to slow the spread.More than 100 vaccine candidates are in various stages of development and testing.This process usually takes years.Researchers are speeding it up as much as they can,and some vaccines are already in late-stage trials.While some say we could have a vaccine by year's end,others predict it will be longer to ensure that the vaccine works,is safe,and can be distributed widely.</p>
		<p>The research team also found that 97% of people who get the virus will develop symptoms within 11 days from the time they are first infected. Any of these symptoms can strike at any time during the course of the illness, from day one to the last days.</p>

		<p>The COVID-19 recovery period depends on the severity of the illness. If you have a mild case, you can expect to recover within about two weeks. But for more severe cases, it could take six weeks or more to feel better, and hospitalization might be required.</p>
